# Rest-Your-Eye-
Save your eyes from the impact of BlueLightz

Inspired and idea by:

@tom-james-watson 's [BreakTimer](https://breaktimer.app/).

@mr-islam 's  [Eye-care Daemon](https://github.com/mr-islam/eyecare-daemon).

The reason for creating this program is:

To remind you to take break in equal intervals and save your eyes from strain

Pros of this program:

-If you unselect the "Allow end opption" You wont be able to exit or close the program even with task manager, the only opptions to wait untill the timer ends or sutdown you pc.

Cons

-Html like Gui
-It would save the changes you made in rest title ect and even show them to you in timer but it wont show them in the main program
